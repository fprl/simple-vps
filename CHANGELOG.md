# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v0.5.0 - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Manifest v2 with `[processes.*]`, `[vars]`, route-level `serve`, redirects,
  per-process resources, route TLS mode, and `[deploy].release`.
- Static-only and mixed container/static deploys, including ignored/generated
  static directories in release artifacts and rollback snapshots.
- Flat env roots at `/var/apps/<app>.<env>/`, runtime env files under
  `runtime/.env`, durable app data under `data/`, and derived infra IDs for
  users, networks, containers, routes, and locks.
- Repo-centric CLI contract with required `--env`, `--config`, `secret set`,
  `backup create/list/rm`, `restart`, `logs`, `ssh`, and `app list`.
- `simple-vps init` templates for `container`, `static`, `php`, and `hono`.
- Release asset publishing, checksum verification, private-release installer
  support, and a scripted fresh-VPS release smoke.

### Changed

- Web deploys now start the next versioned container, health-check it, reload
  Caddy to the new upstream, then remove old containers.
- Backups snapshot app data, active static release assets, applied manifest
  snapshots, and secrets while keeping generated runtime files out of user data.
- Rollback re-applies the selected release snapshot and does not mutate current
  `/data`, current secrets, or rerun `[deploy].release`.
- Docs now lead with the current v0.5.0 manifest/CLI contract, getting-started
  path, and release checklist.

### Removed

- Removed the old public manifest surface: `[services.*]`, route `service`,
  route `type`, `[env.<name>.env]`, `healthcheck`, `healthcheck_status`,
  public `tmpfs`, `net_bind_service`, and nested
  `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/shared`.
- Removed positional-env command aliases and `secret put`.

## v0.5.0-rc4 - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Fresh-VPS matrix proof for Hono/Bun, plain PHP with secrets and `/data`,
  real Astro static output, and mixed API plus `/docs` static routing.

### Changed

- The Astro static example is now a real Astro app with framework build files
  instead of a hand-written HTML placeholder.
- Public install and release docs now point at `v0.5.0-rc4`.
- `install.sh` defaults to `v0.5.0-rc4`.

### Fixed

- The scripted release smoke refreshes `known_hosts` by default for disposable
  rebuilt VPS hosts.
- Private tagged installer downloads now use the GitHub Contents API path when
  authenticated.

## v0.5.0-rc3 - 2026-05-29

### Added

- `simple-vps init` now scaffolds deployable `container`, `static`, `php`, and
  `hono` templates with explicit `--name`, `--server`, `--host`, and `--port`
  knobs.

## v0.5.0-rc2 - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Plain PHP example app with a Dockerfile-backed HTTP process, `/health`, a
  secret reference, and `/data` path convention.
- Real VPS smoke coverage for Hono/Bun, PHP, static-only, and mixed
  container/static deploys on Hetzner Ubuntu 26.04.

### Changed

- Documented the `v0.5.0-rc1` release installer smoke and private-repo
  installer fetch path.
- Replaced the temporary primitive-freeze review brief with ADR-0009, locking
  the v1 CLI and primitive contract.
- Public app commands now use required `--env`/`-e` flags instead of positional
  env arguments, accept `--config` for monorepos, and expose explicit
  `backup create/list/rm` subcommands.
- Clarified that Postgres/Redis/object-storage provisioning is outside the v1
  app primitive; use external/managed/manual services and pass URLs as secrets.
- Updated release and smoke docs for `v0.5.0-rc2`, Ubuntu 24.04/26.04, and
  the PHP example matrix.

## v0.5.0-rc1 - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Manifest v2 static-only deploys with `serve = "dist"` routes, host-side
  static releases, Caddy file serving, `app list` visibility, backup, destroy,
  restore, and rollback coverage.
- Mixed container/static apps: one release can now include the app image plus
  route-level static snapshots, with rollback and restore moving both together.
- `[deploy].release` for deploy-time migration commands in container apps.
- Flat env roots at `/var/apps/<app>.<env>/` with `data/`, `runtime/`, and
  `static/` directories plus a durable `simple-vps.json` identity anchor.
- Example apps for container-only, static-only, and mixed container/static
  deploys.

### Changed

- Public manifest shape now uses `[processes.*]`, `[vars]`,
  `[env.<name>.vars]`, route `process = "web"`, and `health = "/health"`.
- Runtime identity now uses deterministic derived infra IDs for Linux users,
  Podman networks, containers, Caddy fragments, and locks while keeping host
  paths readable.
- Web process deploys start versioned containers, verify health, reload Caddy
  to the next container, then remove the old container.
- Secrets are written with `simple-vps secret set`; runtime env files now live
  under `runtime/.env` instead of app data.
- Backups now snapshot `data/` and active static release assets rather than
  generated runtime files.
- Static route deploys include ignored/generated `serve` directories in the
  uploaded artifact, and static bytes participate in release IDs.
- Release-candidate checklist documents local, fake-VPS, release-build, and
  real-VPS smoke steps.
- Release publishing now runs from a tag-driven GitHub Actions workflow that
  builds checksummed assets and uploads them without local `gh` credentials.

### Removed

- Removed the old public manifest surface: `[services.*]`, route `service`,
  route `type`, `[env.<name>.env]`, `healthcheck`, `healthcheck_status`,
  public `tmpfs`, and `net_bind_service`.
- Removed the nested `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/shared` runtime/data layout.

## v0.4.3 - 2026-05-28

### Added

- `simple-vps app list [--server ...] [--json]` and the matching
  `server app list` helper command. App discovery now comes from Podman
  labels instead of the deleted legacy app/route registries.
- `simple-vps deploy <env> --rebuild`, which passes
  `--no-cache --pull=always` to host-side `podman build`.
- `simple-vps host install --ingress public|cloudflare|private` and
  `--admin public-ssh|tailscale` presets.
- `simple-vps rollback <env> [release] [--json]` and the matching
  `server app rollback` helper command for local image-based rollback.
- Local `simple-vps backup`, `backup list`, `backup rm`, and `restore`
  primitives covering shared data, applied manifest, secrets, and release
  metadata.

### Changed

- Spec installation examples now use the shipped raw-GitHub installer URL
  instead of the unprovisioned `simple-vps.dev/install.sh` placeholder.
- Host install defaults now use public ingress and public SSH admin access;
  Cloudflare Tunnel and Tailscale are enabled through the new presets.
- Removed the half-shipped static app manifest surface. `static = "..."`
  and `type = "static"` are now rejected until static deploys have an actual
  implementation.

### Fixed

- Local builds from `git describe` output such as `v0.4.2-7-g<sha>` no
  longer try to download nonexistent GitHub release helper assets during
  remote host install.

## v0.4.2 - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Release helper downloads now verify `simple-vps-linux-<arch>` against the
  release `SHA256SUMS` file before copying the helper to a VPS.

### Changed

- `install.sh` now detects the install host OS/architecture, downloads the
  matching release binary by default when no local build is available, and
  verifies it against `SHA256SUMS`.

## v0.4.1 - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Remote `host install` now works from a standalone downloaded release binary.
  The installer looks for a matching `simple-vps-linux-<arch>` helper beside
  the current binary or in `SIMPLE_VPS_HELPER_DIR`; if none exists and the
  current binary has a release version, it downloads the matching Linux helper
  from the GitHub release assets. Private release asset downloads honor
  `SIMPLE_VPS_RELEASE_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Changed

- README install instructions now start from release binaries instead of a
  source checkout.

## v0.4.0 - 2026-05-28

This is the first real end-to-end Go implementation cut after the container
runtime pivot. It replaces the old pre-cutover shape with one root Go binary
that serves the public CLI, host installer, and privileged server API.

### Added

- Ubuntu 24.04 host install/converge through `simple-vps host install`.
- Podman-based container deploys from a required Dockerfile.
- Derived host identity under `/etc/simple-vps/apps/<app>/<env>.json` and a
  privileged `simple-vps-server` helper invoked through restricted sudo.
- Public Caddy ingress from generated route fragments under
  `/etc/caddy/conf.d`.
- SSH-based deploy flow that streams a source tarball, builds on the VPS, and
  starts containers through the helper.

### Changed

- Deployment now requires a `Dockerfile`. Legacy non-container deploy paths,
  runtime adapters, and framework detection were removed.
- Remote provision now uses a root-owned helper plus a deploy user instead of
  broad SSH privileges.
- The helper owns app mutation with file locks, route generation, container
  lifecycle, and rollback state.

### Removed

- Removed the legacy Node/TypeScript implementation, adapters, and generated
  `runtime/` bundle.
- Removed Terraform/Ansible provisioning paths and generated infra templates.
