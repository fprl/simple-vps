# ADR-0005: Container Runtime via Required Dockerfile

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-05-24
- **Supersedes**: the runtime story in ADR-0001 (which kept `node`/`bun` as
  external host prerequisites and `static` as a parallel deploy mode).
- **Related**: ADR-0001 (bounded Go provisioner), ADR-0002 (state file layout),
  ADR-0003 (apt repo key trust policy).

## Context

The current code supports three deploy runtimes per env: `bun`, `node`,
`static`. The manifest carries a required `runtime` field that selects between
them. The deploy lifecycle ships a code checkout to
`/var/apps/<name>/releases/<sha>`, runs `<pm> install --production` on the
host, symlinks `current`, and renders a bespoke systemd unit that runs the
configured `command`.

That model has accumulated cost:

- Every new language is new code (lockfile detection, package-manager-specific
  install commands, runtime tool checks).
- Long-tail dependencies the user actually wants to self-host (Postgres,
  Redis, Plausible, n8n, Umami) ship as container images, not apt packages.
- The CLI shape (wrangler-like: many narrow primitives) is mismatched with the
  actual surface (one primary noun: "app"). flyctl-shape is the closer fit
  and is folded into this ADR rather than punted to a follow-up.
- The "what runtime am I" question is redundant the moment a `Dockerfile`
  exists in the repo. The file is the answer.

Three options were considered:

1. **Keep native runtimes.** Rejected: every new language is new code, and
   containers are required for the long tail anyway.
2. **Hybrid (native fast path for Bun/Node + container escape hatch).**
   Rejected: two code paths, and the cold-start optimization (5 ms vs
   ~300 ms) does not matter for long-running web services.
3. **Container-shaped via required Dockerfile, with static files as the only
   special case.** Chosen by this ADR.

## Decision

### 1. Two app shapes, no `runtime` field

The `runtime` field is removed from the manifest. App shape is inferred from
the working tree:

| Has Dockerfile | Has `static = "..."` | Shape | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| yes | no | container | build image + run container |
| no | yes | static | upload directory + Caddy `file_server` |
| yes | yes | error | manifest is ambiguous, fail fast |
| no | no | error | nothing to deploy, fail fast |

Static is preserved as a first-class shape because Caddy already terminates
TLS and serves files. Wrapping a static directory in a container to serve it
adds cost with no benefit.

"Static" here means the build output requires no runtime to serve.
Frameworks that produce static output by default qualify: Hugo, 11ty,
Jekyll, Astro `output: 'static'`, SvelteKit `adapter-static`, and plain
SPAs (Vite + React/Vue). Frameworks running in SSR mode are container
apps regardless of how "static-looking" the source tree appears: Astro
`output: 'server'`/`'hybrid'`, Next.js with server features, Remix,
SvelteKit `adapter-node`. The shape is determined by what the build
produces, not by which framework was used.

**Identity constraints**:

| Field | Pattern | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| App name | `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,40}$` | readable app handle, lowercase and shell-safe |
| Env name | `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,30}$` | readable deployment target, lowercase and shell-safe |
| Service name | `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,30}$` | readable container service name, lowercase and DNS-safe |

Generated host/container identifiers are bounded internally. For names that
would exceed host limits, `internal/identity` keeps a readable prefix and adds
a short stable hash: Unix usernames stay under the 31-character Linux limit,
and container DNS names stay under the 63-character DNS label limit. Human
surfaces (`status`, `logs`, validation errors) keep the manifest names.

### 2. Container engine: Podman

Podman has no long-running daemon, integrates with systemd via
`podman generate systemd`, and accepts unmodified Dockerfiles via
BuildKit-compatible `podman build`. Same UX as Docker, meaningfully
smaller blast radius — no persistent root daemon, no socket to leak.

The helper invokes Podman as **root** (it already holds root via
passwordless sudo from `deploy@`). Container *processes* run as the
per-`(app, env)` user `app-<app>-<env>` per Section 7's security
floor (`--user`, `--cap-drop=ALL`,
`--security-opt=no-new-privileges`, read-only rootfs, resource caps).

Truly rootless Podman per app user was considered and rejected:
per-user image storage breaks shared image caches across apps, rootless
networking has port-binding limitations (no <1024 binds without
setcap), and on a single-host VPS the operator already holds root via
SSH — the marginal "extra layer before host root" isolation gain does
not outweigh the operational complexity. The win that does carry over
from rootless mode is the absence of a persistent root daemon; that
remains true under rootful Podman invocation because `podman` is a
short-lived CLI, not a long-running service.

Docker remains a valid escape hatch if a future use case demonstrates
it is required, but Podman is the supported default.

### 3. Required Dockerfile — no `image:` field

Two shapes were considered:

- **A. Support both `image = "repo@sha256:..."` and a Dockerfile.** A
  digest-pinned image string is a legitimate shape for apps where the
  upstream image needs zero configuration. Small, verifiable, explicit.
- **B. Require a Dockerfile, even a one-liner.** Single schema; the
  moment any tweak is needed (env init script, custom config, alternate
  entrypoint), the Dockerfile is the only place that can express it.

Chosen: **B**. The argument for A is real — a no-config image is one
line either way. The argument against A: any non-trivial container deploy
eventually wants configuration, at which point users migrate from
`image:` to `dockerfile:` and the schema has carried both forms
indefinitely for nothing. The uniformity of one path through the
build/run pipeline is worth the small friction of writing a one-line
Dockerfile for the no-config edge case:

```dockerfile
# apps/postgres/Dockerfile
FROM postgres:16-alpine
# config tweaks live here, if any
```

Every container app has a Dockerfile, even a one-liner. The manifest
carries only VPS-facing concerns: ports, health checks, routes, secret
bindings, resource limits.

### 4. Convention-driven volumes

simple-vps bind-mounts `/var/apps/<app>/shared/` into every container at the
same path. No `volumes` field in the manifest for the common case. The
shared directory contains the env file and any persistent data the app
writes.

Cross-app sharing (for example, Litestream reading another app's data
directory) uses a small `mounts = ["other-app"]` field that resolves to
`--mount type=bind,src=/var/apps/other-app/shared,dst=/var/apps/other-app/shared,ro`
on the container.

### 5. Image-based releases — `releases/` removed for container apps

Container images are the immutable release artifact. For **container
apps**, the per-deploy `releases/<sha>` source checkout pattern (current
code) is removed; images replace it. Per-app-per-env on-disk state for
container apps shrinks to:

```
/var/apps/<app>/<env>/
  shared/            bind-mounted into container, persists across deploys
```

Path is `(app, env)`-scoped per Section 1's identity constraints, so
prod and staging on the same VPS never collide on disk.

Images are tagged `simple-vps/<app>-<env>:<sha>` with labels
`app=<app>`, `env=<env>`, and `simple_vps_release=<sha>`. Listing
deploys: `podman images --filter label=app=<app> --filter label=env=<env>`.
Rollback: run an older tagged image for the same `(app, env)`.

Static apps keep a `releases/` directory for snapshot-based retention;
see Section 12. The `keep_releases` knob is shared by both worlds.

### 6. Release retention

The existing `keep_releases` knob (default 5) applies to images. After a
successful deploy:

1. List images by label `app=<name>` sorted by created date.
2. Keep the currently-running image, the previous-successful image, and the
   N most recent.
3. Untag the rest.
4. Run `podman image prune -f` to reap untagged images and unused layers.

The release retention semantics from the current code (current + previous +
keep N) are preserved end-to-end.

### 7. Container security floor (default, not opt-in)

Every container starts with:

```
--user $(id -u app-<app>-<env>):$(id -g app-<app>-<env>)
--cap-drop=ALL
--cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE        # only when binding <1024
--security-opt=no-new-privileges
--read-only
--tmpfs=/tmp:size=64m
--memory=<from manifest>
--cpus=<from manifest>
--pids-limit=512
--network=app-<app>-<env>
```

Identity is `(app, env)`-scoped: per-env system user, per-env Podman
network. Prod and staging on the same VPS run as different users on
different networks, with separate filesystem ownership over
`/var/apps/<app>/<env>/`.

Disallowed at the API level: `--privileged`, `docker.sock` mounts,
`--pid=host`, `--ipc=host`, `--network=host`. These defeat the security
floor and have no use case the manifest needs to express.

### 8. Routes can share a host via path

Today routes are keyed by host. The new uniqueness key is
`(server, host, path)` — same `(host, path)` on the same VPS belongs to
exactly one `(app, env)` pair. Two app/env combinations may share a
host when their path prefixes differ:

```toml
# in api app's manifest
[routes.api]
host = "myapp.com"
path = "/api"
type = "proxy"
service = "web"
```

```toml
# in spa app's manifest
[routes.www]
host = "myapp.com"
# path defaults to "/"
type = "static"
```

Caddy emits one site block per host and one `handle` block per path.

Same `(host, path)` for different `(app, env)` pairs is a hard conflict
and a deploy-time error. The `--force` flag exists only for same
`(app, env)` collisions (replacing one's own route definition). It does
not transfer ownership across apps or across envs.

Moving a route between app/env pairs is a two-step operation: remove
the route from the owning manifest and deploy it; add the route to the
new manifest and deploy it. Two explicit, grep-able actions; no hidden
takeover path.

### 9. Deploy is content-addressed

`simple-vps deploy <env>` does as little work as the diff requires. It
is the universal verb; there is no separate `deploy --config-only` or
`apply` flag.

**Content signature** components depend on app shape:

- **Container apps:** `(git_sha, manifest_hash)`. The git SHA covers
  the build context because `git archive HEAD` is content-addressed by
  SHA.
- **Static apps:** `(static_tree_hash, manifest_hash)`. The static
  directory is typically gitignored, so git SHA does not cover what
  is actually shipped. `static_tree_hash` is computed by the client
  deterministically (sha256 over a sorted list of
  `(path, mode, content_sha256)` for each file in the static tree).

**Client-side signature computation.** All signature components are
known to the client without uploading anything — `git_sha` and
`manifest_hash` come from the local working tree; `static_tree_hash`
is computed locally over the static directory. The client asks the
helper for the last-deployed signature via a cheap SSH probe
(`simple-vps server signature <app> <env>`), compares locally, and
decides whether to upload at all. The helper re-verifies after upload
to catch tampering.

Deploy modes:

| Diff | Action | Typical time |
|---|---|---|
| No diff | No-op, report "nothing to deploy", no upload | ~1 s (one SSH probe) |
| Manifest only | Reconcile config (routes / env / secrets / mounts / limits) | 1-3 s; +container restart if runtime flags changed |
| Container: code or Dockerfile changed | Build new image, atomic multi-service swap (Section 10), reconcile config | 5-90 s depending on layer cache |
| Static: tree hash changed | Upload tarball, snapshot to `releases/<id>`, atomic symlink swap | 1-3 s |

This collapses the wrangler-style "many imperative verbs" surface into
one declarative verb that converges actual state to the manifest's
intent. It matches `fly deploy`. The user's mental model is uniform:
edit manifest (or rebuild the static output), run deploy, the system
figures out the cheapest path.

**`--dirty` flag.** Skips the "clean worktree" check and tars the
working tree directly (instead of `git archive HEAD`). Signature
becomes `(dirty-<unix-timestamp>, manifest_hash)`, which is always
unique — every dirty deploy goes through the full build path. Useful
for iterating on a staging env without committing.

**`--rebuild` flag.** Forces the build path even when the signature
matches. Used to pick up upstream base image changes when bases are
mutable tags (e.g., `FROM oven/bun:1`). Passes
`--no-cache --pull=always` to `podman build`:

- `--no-cache` busts Podman's layer cache (every `RUN` step
  re-executes).
- `--pull=always` forces re-pull of every `FROM` base from the
  registry (Podman's default pull policy is `missing`, which only
  pulls when not locally cached, so `--no-cache` alone does **not**
  refresh bases).

Both are needed together. Digest-pinned bases
(`FROM oven/bun:1@sha256:...`) remain the recommended approach for
strict supply-chain control; `--rebuild` is the pragmatic escape
hatch when bases are unpinned.

**Pre-deploy reference resolution.** Before any state mutation, the
helper resolves every `@secret:KEY` reference in the manifest against
the `(app, env, key)` secret store (see Section 13). Any missing
reference → fail immediately, no half-apply.

The helper persists the last-successful-deploy signature in its state
file (extending the ADR-0002 schema), keyed by `(app, env)`.

### 10. Container deploy lifecycle (full-build path)

When Section 9 selects the full-build mode, the deploy is **atomic at
the app level**: all services of the app come up as a new set, all are
verified healthy together, then Caddy swaps to the new set in a single
reload. Any failure during verification tears down the entire new set
and leaves the previous set serving traffic.

1. **Client:** `git archive HEAD` (or worktree tar for `--dirty`) →
   tarball. Manifest_hash computed locally.
2. **Client → helper (SSH):** stream tarball; helper runs
   `systemd-run --scope -p CPUQuota=75% podman build -t
   simple-vps/<app>-<env>:<sha> --label app=<app> --label env=<env>
   --label simple_vps_release=<sha> -`. The CPUQuota cap bounds
   contention with apps already serving traffic on the same host.
3. **Helper — start new set:** for each service declared in the
   manifest, allocate a fresh host-loopback port (Section 16) and
   start `podman run --name app-<app>-<env>-<service>-new` with:
   - The Section 7 security floor (per-env user `app-<app>-<env>`,
     per-env network `app-<app>-<env>`).
   - `--env-file /var/apps/<app>/<env>/shared/.env` (resolved per
     Section 9 pre-deploy step).
   - `--mount` for `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/shared` and any declared
     `mounts`.
   - `--publish 127.0.0.1:<allocated-port>:<service-port>` for
     services that declare `port`. Workers (no `port`) skip this.
   - `--entrypoint` overridden when the service declares a `command`
     (Section 13); otherwise the Dockerfile's `CMD` runs.
4. **Per-service verification (must all pass):**
   - **Web services** (have `port`): `curl
     127.0.0.1:<allocated-port><healthcheck>` until 2xx or timeout.
   - **Workers** (no `port`): "settle" check — wait N seconds
     (default 10), verify the container is still `running` (not
     exited, not in restart loop). A worker that crashes immediately
     fails verification.
5. **Atomic swap (only when ALL services pass):** rewrite Caddy
   upstreams for every web service in this app from old port to new
   port in one pass, then a single `caddy reload`. The swap is
   single-reload, never per-service.
6. **Reap old:** stop and remove every previous
   `app-<app>-<env>-<service>` container, rename each `*-new` to drop
   the suffix, release the old allocated ports back to the pool.
7. **Reconcile:** apply manifest routes (Section 13), record new
   content signature (Section 9) in helper state, untag stale images
   per Section 6, `podman image prune -f`.

**Any failure during step 4:** stop and remove every `*-new` container
started in step 3, release their allocated ports, leave the previous
service set and Caddy upstreams untouched, fail the deploy. No state
mutation, no partial deploy.

The atomic model is meaningfully stricter than per-service rolling: a
deploy that introduces a worker bug fails the whole deploy and prod
stays on the known-good set — including the unaffected web service.
The cost is brief downtime if the new set is slow to come up (covered
by the existing previous-set Caddy upstream remaining live throughout
step 4).

### 11. Config-only reconcile (manifest-only diff path)

When Section 9 selects the config-only mode, the deploy skips build entirely
and applies the diff:

- **Routes diff:** regenerate Caddyfile, `caddy reload`. No container touch.
- **Env / secret diff:** write new env file to `/var/apps/<app>/shared/.env`,
  restart the running container (env is bound at start).
- **Resource limit / mount diff:** recreate the container with new flags
  (Podman cannot live-update most security or mount settings).

Typical time: 1-3 seconds for a route-only change; longer when a container
restart is needed (still under 10 seconds for a small app).

After a successful config-only reconcile, helper state is updated with the
new `manifest_hash`; `git_sha` is unchanged.

### 12. Static deploy: ship a directory, no build

simple-vps does **not** run any build for static apps. The user produces
the directory however they want (`astro build`, `npm run build`, Hugo,
plain HTML) before calling `simple-vps deploy`. The manifest's `static`
field points at the produced directory.

This is deliberate: it keeps simple-vps language- and build-tool-agnostic
for static deploys, just as the Dockerfile owns the build for container
apps. simple-vps owns deployment, not source-to-artifact transformation.

Per-app on-disk layout for static apps:

```
/var/apps/<app>/<env>/
  shared/                       persistent app state (env file, etc.)
  web -> releases/<id>          symlink: active release
  releases/
    20260524-153045-abc1234/    deploy snapshot
    20260523-092311-def5678/
```

Lifecycle:

1. **Client:** copy the directory at the manifest's `static` path →
   tarball.
2. **Client → helper (SSH):** stream tarball.
3. **Helper:** extract to `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/releases/<id>/`,
   where `<id>` is timestamp + short git SHA (or `dirty-<timestamp>`
   for an unclean worktree).
4. **Helper:** atomic symlink swap via `rename(2)`:

   ```
   ln -sfn releases/<id> web.next
   mv -Tf web.next web
   ```

   `ln -sfn` alone is not atomic — it unlinks then re-creates the
   symlink, leaving a brief window where `web` does not exist. The
   temp-symlink + `mv -Tf` pattern uses `rename(2)`, which is atomic
   for symlink replacement on Linux. Requests in flight during the
   swap either see the old release or the new one, never a missing
   path.
5. **Helper:** reconcile manifest routes (Caddy `root` pointing at
   `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/web` + `file_server`).
6. `caddy reload`.
7. Prune older release directories per Section 6 semantics (current +
   previous-successful + keep N most recent).

No container, no port, no health check. Rollback for static apps:
`simple-vps rollback <env> [release-id]` swaps the symlink to an older
release directory. No rebuild, no re-upload.

**Destroy scope.** `simple-vps destroy <env>` and `destroy --purge`
operate only on `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/` and `(app, env, *)` state
entries. Destroying staging never touches prod's files or state. The
parent `/var/apps/<app>/` directory is removed only when the last env
of that app is destroyed.

The retention pattern (filesystem releases dir + active symlink) is
different from container apps (tagged images in Podman storage), but the
`keep_releases` knob means the same thing in both worlds: how many old
releases stay available for rollback. The user-facing `static = "..."`
field is the only knob; the server-side layout is internal and not
configurable.

### 13. CLI shape: manifest is the source of truth

The CLI is app-centric (flyctl-shape), not resource-centric (wrangler-shape).
One primary noun ("app"), few verbs operating on it, one source of truth
(the manifest), one universal reconcile verb (`deploy`).

The CLI is app-centric (flyctl-shape), not resource-centric
(wrangler-shape). One primary noun ("app"), few verbs, one source of
truth (the manifest), one universal reconcile verb (`deploy`).

**Declarative state lives in the manifest:**
- App shape (Dockerfile or `static = "..."`)
- Services (port, healthcheck, resources, mounts, optional `command`
  override per service)
- Routes (host, path, type, service)
- Env values per env (non-secret, in `[env.<env>.env]` blocks)
- Secret references (`@secret:KEY`, resolved server-side against the
  `(app, env, key)` secret store)

**Imperative state via CLI:**
- Secret values (`secret put/list/rm <env> <key>`) — sensitive,
  scoped to `(app, env, key)`, never in a checked-in file
- Lifecycle actions (`deploy`, `restart`, `rollback`, `destroy`)
- Observability (`status`, `logs`, `ssh`)

**Multi-service from one image.** When an app has more than one
service, all services build from the same Dockerfile (one image,
shared layers). Each service gets its own container; per-service
`command` overrides the Dockerfile's `CMD`:

```toml
name = "myapp"

[env.production]
server = "deploy@vps.example.com"

[services.web]
port = 3000
healthcheck = "/health"
# no command → uses Dockerfile CMD (e.g., "bun run src/server.ts")

[services.worker]
command = "bun run src/worker.ts"
# no port → worker; container runs the override, no Caddy upstream,
# no HTTP health check (settle check per Section 10)

[routes.app]
host = "myapp.com"
type = "proxy"
service = "web"
```

Per-service Dockerfile (different base images per service) is **out
of scope** for v1 — covered in "Out of scope" below. Same-image with
command overrides covers the common case (web + worker from one
codebase, across Bun/Node/Go/Rust/Ruby/PHP/Python stacks).

**Env values and secret references.** Non-secret env values live
inline in `[env.<env>.env]` blocks; secrets are referenced by
`@secret:KEY` syntax that resolves server-side:

```toml
[env.production.env]
LOG_LEVEL = "info"
PUBLIC_API_URL = "https://api.myapp.com"
DATABASE_URL = "@secret:db_url"

[env.staging.env]
LOG_LEVEL = "debug"
PUBLIC_API_URL = "https://api.staging.myapp.com"
DATABASE_URL = "@secret:db_url"   # same reference, different value resolved
```

Rules for `[env.<env>.env]` values:

- **String values only.** TOML bool/int/array/inline-table values are
  rejected at `simple-vps check` with a clear error. If you want
  `PORT = 3000`, write `PORT = "3000"`. No silent coercion.
- **`@secret:KEY` is whole-value only.** No partial interpolation
  (e.g., `"https://user:@secret:pw@host"` is not supported in v1).
  Whole value or a literal string.
- **Reserved prefix.** Values that begin with `@secret:` are always
  references. A literal env value starting with that prefix is
  rejected with: `value starts with reserved prefix '@secret:', use
  the secret store instead`.
- **Pre-deploy resolution.** Helper resolves every `@secret:KEY`
  against `(app, env, key)` before any state mutation (Section 9).
  Missing reference → fail immediately, no half-apply.
- **Secrets never in state.** Resolved secret values land **only** in
  the runtime env file at `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/shared/.env`
  (mode `0600`, owned by `app-<app>-<env>`). Helper state files
  carry references only.

**Secret scoping.** Secrets are stored on the server keyed by
`(app, env, key)`. Both envs of an app reference the same key name
(`@secret:db_url`); the server resolves to the per-env stored value.
Users do not encode env into key names like `db_url_staging`.

**Client commands after the pivot (as amended by ADR-0006 and SPEC):**

| Verb | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `init` | scaffold `simple-vps.toml` + `Dockerfile` (container) or `simple-vps.toml` (static) |
| `check` | validate manifest (including identity-length and env-value rules) |
| `setup <env>` | create app/env on host (per-env, one-time) |
| `deploy <env>` | stream source tarball, build on the host, run services |
| `deploy <env> --dirty` | tar working tree, skip clean-worktree check |
| `deploy <env> --rebuild` | force build path, refresh upstream bases |
| `status <env>` | Podman-label-sourced service status |
| `logs <env> [service]` | `podman logs` for the labelled container |
| `ssh <env>` | SSH into VPS |
| `restart <env> <service>` | restart a service (no rebuild) |
| `rollback <env> [release]` | planned |
| `destroy <env>` | tear down one env of the app (scoped per Section 12) |
| `secret put/list/rm <env> <key>` | manage secret values scoped to (app, env, key) |
| `host status/doctor` | host-level checks |

**Removed:**
- Client-side `route` verb (route info now surfaced under `status`).
- `env push` (use `secret put` per key; bulk import was a
  deploy-state hazard, and non-secret env now lives in the manifest).

**Helper-side route surface is removed.** `server app apply` writes the
per-(app, env) Caddy fragment directly from the validated manifest. The
old route registry and helper route CRUD/list verbs went away with
`apps.json` / `routes.json`.

### 14. Provisioner changes

`internal/provision/install.go`:

- **Adds:** Podman install from Ubuntu 24.04 Universe (`apt install
  podman`). ADR-0003 (third-party apt repo key trust) does not apply
  here — first-party Ubuntu archives are trusted via
  `ubuntu-keyring`. The Universe-shipped Podman (4.9.x) provides
  rootless mode, systemd integration, and the security flags Section 7
  relies on. Upstream Podman 5.x via Kubic is not required and not
  configured by default.
- **Removes:** Node, Bun, npm, pnpm, yarn install paths and runtime
  prerequisite checks.

Minimum host footprint after the pivot:

- `simple-vps` helper binary
- Podman
- Caddy
- `rsync` (Ubuntu base, used for artifact upload)

That is the complete supported install surface. Optional add-ons (Tailscale,
cloudflared, Litestream) remain user-driven; simple-vps does not enforce
them.

The bounded operation budget from ADR-0001 does not change; only the set of
packages provisioned does. No new primitives are required.

### 15. Helper owns root-side artifact generation

The helper runs as root via passwordless sudo from the `deploy@` user.
Every helper command is a root operation initiated remotely. The current
code accepts uploaded systemd unit files and installs them, which gives
the client effective control over root-installed unit content — more
privilege than the design needs.

The container pivot is the right moment to tighten this boundary. After
the pivot:

- The client uploads **only typed input**: the manifest, a source
  tarball (for container builds), a static-directory tarball, and
  secret values.
- The helper **synthesizes all privileged artifacts** server-side from
  that typed input: systemd unit files, Caddyfile, `podman run` flag
  sets, env files.
- The helper rejects any unit file, runtime flag, or Caddy directive
  that did not originate from its own synthesis.

In practice the helper exports verbs like `app apply --from-manifest`,
`route apply --from-manifest`, and `secret put`. It does **not** export
verbs like `app install-unit <unit-file>` that accept uploaded unit
content. Where current code uploads a rendered unit, the new code
uploads the manifest and the helper renders the unit.

This narrows the trust boundary to "manifest schema + secret values,"
both validated server-side. Compromised client credentials still grant
deploy access — unavoidable — but cannot inject arbitrary unit content,
container flags, or out-of-schema Caddy directives.

### 16. Networking: host-loopback published ports

Host-Caddy talks to containers via **host-loopback published ports**.
This is the only routing path; Caddy does not join any Podman network.

Concretely:

- Each service in the manifest is assigned a host-loopback port by the
  helper at deploy time, from a configurable range (default
  `33000-33999`).
- The container is started with
  `--publish 127.0.0.1:<allocated>:<service-port>`. The bind is
  loopback-only — the port is not exposed on any external interface.
- Caddy upstream is `127.0.0.1:<allocated>`.
- Health checks hit `127.0.0.1:<allocated><healthcheck-path>`.
- During a full-build deploy, the new container gets a fresh port; the
  old port is released to the pool only after the old container stops
  (Section 10 step 6). The blue/green swap is at the Caddy-upstream
  layer, not at the port-binding layer.

The per-`(app, env)` Podman network `app-<app>-<env>` still exists,
but its purpose is **intra-app container-to-container traffic**
(multi-service apps where, for example, a worker calls the web service
by container name). It is not the path Caddy uses to reach app
services. Prod and staging on the same VPS run on separate Podman
networks; their containers cannot reach each other by name.

State: the helper records `(app, env, service) -> host_port` in its
state file and survives restarts. Port collisions are prevented by the
allocator across all `(app, env, service)` tuples on the host;
manifests do not specify host ports.

Trade-offs vs the alternative "host Caddy joins the Podman network and
resolves container names":

- Host-loopback wins on simplicity (Caddy stays a plain host service,
  no Podman networking on the Caddy side), debuggability
  (`curl 127.0.0.1:<port>` from the host always works), and
  compatibility (works identically under rootful or rootless Podman).
- Container-network membership would let Caddy address upstreams by
  container name without port allocation, at the cost of putting Caddy
  inside Podman's network plane. Rejected for this tool's
  "Caddy is a host service" architecture.

Static apps do not use host-loopback ports; host Caddy serves their
files directly via `file_server` (Section 12).

## Consequences

### What this enables

- Any language with a Dockerfile is supported with zero simple-vps code.
  Elixir, Ruby, Python, Go, Rust, PHP, Bun, Node, Deno — same code path.
- Third-party self-hosted tools (Postgres, Redis, Plausible, n8n, Umami)
  deploy with a one-line Dockerfile.
- No mandatory local container toolchain. `podman build` runs on the
  VPS (Section 10), so a clean machine can deploy without Docker or
  Podman installed locally — only `git`, `ssh`, and the `simple-vps`
  client are required on the deploying machine. In practice, users
  iterating on a custom Dockerfile will still want a local container
  runtime for fast feedback; but the happy path (init-scaffolded
  Dockerfiles or one-line `FROM <image>` Dockerfiles) requires nothing
  on the client.
- Manifest shrinks ~60% for typical apps. `runtime`, `command`,
  `build.install`, lockfile detection all delete.
- ~600–800 net lines removed from the codebase. ~150–200 added back for
  container plumbing.
- One debug axis disappears ("is this a lockfile-detection bug or a deploy
  bug?").
- Routes and other config changes take 1-3 seconds end-to-end; no rebuild,
  no restart, no waiting on layer downloads.
- One mental model: edit the manifest, run deploy. The system picks the
  cheapest reconcile path. No drift between CLI-mutated state and
  manifest-declared state.
- Privileged-helper trust boundary narrows to typed manifest input plus
  secret values (Section 15). Clients can no longer inject arbitrary
  systemd unit content, container flags, or Caddy directives.
- Prod and staging (and other envs) on one VPS, fully isolated: per-env
  user, per-env Podman network, per-env paths, per-env secret store.
  No "separate VPS for staging" workaround needed.
- Multi-service apps deploy atomically: a bad worker fails the whole
  deploy and prod stays on the known-good set, including the unaffected
  web service. No half-deploys.
- `--rebuild` provides an explicit refresh-from-upstream path for
  mutable base tags (`FROM oven/bun:1`), with `--no-cache --pull=always`
  semantics that actually re-pull bases (default Podman pull policy
  `missing` would not).

### What this gives up

- Cold-start time per container is ~300 ms vs ~5 ms for native Bun.
  Acceptable for long-running services; would be the wrong call for
  stateless function-style workloads, which simple-vps does not target.
- Disk: each image carries its own layer set. Layers are deduplicated
  across builds, but a long-running VPS with many apps will use more disk
  than the native model. Section 6 retention bounds this.
- Build runs on the VPS via `podman build` over the streamed tarball.
  Faster client-side deploys but more VPS CPU and temporary disk during
  deploy. Section 10's CPUQuota cap bounds the worst case.
- Native systemd sandbox (`User=app-X`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, etc.) is no
  longer the primary isolation primitive for app code. The container
  security floor in Section 7 replaces it. The floor must hold from day
  one.
- No `route add` / `route remove` CLI for ad-hoc tinkering. All route
  changes go through manifest + deploy. The trade-off is bought back by
  config-only deploys being seconds, not minutes.
- VPS needs outbound HTTPS for `podman build` (base image pulls, language
  package installs). Air-gapped VPS scenarios are not supported and would
  require build-on-client, which is out of scope here.
- No client-side escape hatch for systemd unit content or container
  flags. Custom needs must be expressed through the manifest schema; if
  the schema cannot express it, the answer is to extend the schema in a
  follow-up ADR, not to side-channel unit content through the helper.

### What becomes harder

- "What is currently running?" requires `podman inspect`, not
  `cat /var/apps/<name>/current/file`. Trade-off accepted: the image
  is immutable and inspectable; the previous mutable filesystem
  release was easier to grep but easier to drift.
- Long identity names. `app-<app>-<env>-<service>` is verbose in
  `podman ps` output and systemd unit listings. Section 1's regex
  limits keep them within OS limits; the verbosity is the cost of
  unambiguous per-`(app, env, service)` identity.
- Adding a new first-class deploy shape (a WASM module, a Firecracker
  microVM) would be its own ADR. Container + static in this ADR is the
  entire surface.

## Out of scope (do not litigate later without a new ADR)

- **Multi-app-per-manifest.** Each manifest describes one app. Co-locating
  Postgres + API in one repo means two simple-vps manifests in
  subdirectories, or two separate repos. A future ADR may add
  `[apps.<name>]` blocks if a real use case demands it.
- **Image registry support.** Builds happen on the host; images live in
  local Podman storage. Multi-host deploys would need a registry, but
  simple-vps is single-host.
- **Build on client / image upload.** Build runs on the VPS. The client
  ships source, not a built image. Adds a dependency only Internet-isolated
  VPS scenarios would need.
- **Native runtime support.** Removed and not re-added under a flag.
  Container or static is the entire surface.
- **BuildKit on Docker.** Podman build is the supported tool.
- **Cross-app `--force` route takeover.** Same-`(host, path)` collisions
  across apps require explicit removal from the owning manifest first.
- **Force-Docker for static apps.** Wrapping a static directory in a
  Caddy/nginx container would simplify the codebase (one lifecycle) but
  cost ~30–50 MB RAM per static app, slower deploys, and friction for
  the most common static use case. Rejected on RAM + UX grounds.
- **Container supply-chain enforcement.** Digest-pinned base images are
  the supply-chain-strict equivalent of ADR-0003/0004 for the build
  context. The friction of manual SHA lookups on every base image bump
  outweighs the win for the solo-dev VPS audience this tool targets.
  Documented in Notes; not enforced.
- **Per-service Dockerfile.** Multi-service apps in v1 share one
  Dockerfile and one image; services differ via the per-service
  `command` override (Section 13). A future ADR may add per-service
  `dockerfile = "..."` if a real use case demands it. Until then,
  "install all needed system deps in one shared Dockerfile" or "split
  into separate simple-vps apps" covers the space.
- **Env value interpolation.** `@secret:KEY` is whole-value only in
  v1. Partial interpolation (`"https://user:@secret:pw@host"`) is a
  future ADR if real demand surfaces.
- **Server-side opaque build generation.** `simple-vps` does not
  generate Dockerfiles at deploy time. `init` may scaffold a
  Dockerfile (via vendored detection logic) that the user owns from
  that point on. Hidden server-side generation would create a second
  invisible platform contract; users self-hosting need the build
  recipe inspectable in git, debuggable with standard container
  tooling. The "init scaffolds, user owns" model is the answer to
  zero-config UX without sacrificing transparency. This rejection
  covers the auto-detect-and-build-on-server category as a whole —
  Cloud Native Buildpacks (Paketo / Heroku), Nixpacks, and similar
  source-to-image tooling are all out for the same reason: the
  Dockerfile is the contract `simple-vps` relies on, not an
  auto-generated artifact the user cannot see or version.

## Cutover plan

This project is pre-user. There is no compatibility window.

Cutover is complete when:

**Manifest schema and validation**

1. `runtime` field is removed; app shape inferred from
   Dockerfile/`static` presence per Section 1.
2. Manifest identity regexes use the current widened policy: app names match
   `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,40}$`; env and service names match
   `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,30}$`. Generated host/container identifiers are bounded
   inside `internal/identity`.
3. `[env.<env>.env]` blocks accept string values only; bool/int/
   array/inline-table rejected at check time.
4. `@secret:KEY` values are whole-value references only; partial
   interpolation rejected. Literal values beginning with `@secret:`
   rejected with the reserved-prefix error.
5. Path-validation constraint forcing `path = /var/apps/<name>` is
   removed; path is computed from `(app, env)`.

**Identity, paths, and per-env isolation**

6. Per-`(app, env)` on-disk layout: `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/shared/`
   for container apps; `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/{shared, web,
   releases/}` for static apps.
7. Per-env system user `app-<app>-<env>` owns its env's filesystem
   tree. Provisioner creates the user on first deploy of that env.
8. Per-env Podman network `app-<app>-<env>` for intra-`(app, env)`
   container-to-container traffic.
9. Container names `app-<app>-<env>-<service>`; systemd units
   `simple-<app>-<env>-<service>.service`.
10. `destroy <env>` and `destroy --purge` scoped to
    `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/` and `(app, env, *)` state entries only.
    Parent `/var/apps/<app>/` removed only when the last env is
    destroyed.

**Deploy lifecycle**

11. `deploy` is content-addressed with shape-dependent signature:
    container apps `(git_sha, manifest_hash)`; static apps
    `(static_tree_hash, manifest_hash)`. Computed client-side; helper
    re-verifies after upload.
12. `--dirty` flag tars working tree, signature becomes
    `(dirty-<unix-timestamp>, manifest_hash)`.
13. `--rebuild` flag forces build path and passes
    `--no-cache --pull=always` to `podman build`.
14. Pre-deploy step resolves every `@secret:KEY` against `(app, env,
    key)` store; missing reference fails deploy before any state
    mutation.
15. Container deploys are atomic at the app level: start all
    `*-new` services → verify web (HTTP) and worker (settle) → single
    Caddy reload swapping all upstreams → reap old set. Any
    verification failure tears down all `*-new`, leaves prev set
    untouched.
16. Static deploys land in `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/releases/<id>/`
    with `rename(2)` symlink swap (`ln -sfn ... web.next` then
    `mv -Tf web.next web`).
17. `podman build` runs with `CPUQuota=75%` to bound contention with
    serving traffic.

**Helper boundary, state, and networking**

18. Helper rejects uploaded systemd unit files and uploaded `podman
    run` flag sets. All privileged artifacts are synthesized
    server-side from typed manifest input. The current
    `app install-unit` verb is removed; `app apply --from-manifest
    <app> <env>` replaces it.
19. Helper state schema (ADR-0002) extends to record per-`(app, env)`
    last-successful-deploy signature and per-`(app, env, service) ->
    host_port` allocations from a configurable range (default
    33000-33999).
20. Secrets are stored on the server keyed by `(app, env, key)`.
    CLI: `simple-vps secret put <env> <key>` writes to the per-env
    scope. Resolved secret values land only in the runtime env file
    at `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/shared/.env` (`0600`, owned by
    `app-<app>-<env>`); state files carry references only.
21. Host-Caddy reaches container services via
    `--publish 127.0.0.1:<allocated>:<service-port>`. Caddy does not
    join any Podman network.
22. Route uniqueness key end-to-end is `(server, host, path)`;
    `--force` only overrides same-`(app, env)` collisions, never
    cross-`(app, env)`.

**Provisioner, CLI, runtime**

23. Provisioner installs Podman from Ubuntu 24.04 Universe (no
    third-party repo configured); no longer installs Node, Bun, or
    package managers.
24. Podman runs rootful (helper invokes as root); container processes
    run as the per-env user `app-<app>-<env>` per Section 7. No
    rootless Podman per-user setup.
25. `cmd/client/client.go` no longer references `bun`, `node`,
    lockfile detection, or package-manager install commands.
26. Client `route` command removed; route info surfaced in
    `status`.
27. Helper route CRUD/list verbs removed; `server app apply` writes
    the per-(app, env) Caddy fragment directly from the manifest.

**Coverage**

28. Fake-VPS coverage exercises: container build, multi-service
    atomic swap, worker-settle rollback, health-check rollback,
    static deploy with snapshot/symlink, image prune, path-based
    routing collision, no-op deploy, config-only deploy,
    `--dirty` deploy, `--rebuild` deploy, prod+staging on one VPS
    (per-env identity), secret pre-deploy resolution failure,
    per-env destroy scope.

## Notes

- "Dockerfile" here means OCI-compatible build context; Podman accepts the
  same syntax. The name is convention, not lock-in.
- Section 6 (release retention) preserves the existing `keep_releases` knob
  name and default. Users who set it before the pivot get the same
  semantics after.
- Section 8 (path-based routing) is the answer to "two apps, same host."
  Cross-app `--force` takeover is intentionally not supported; the foot-gun
  outweighs any ergonomics the manifest cannot express more clearly.
- Section 13's CLI surface shrinks the cmd/helper route file from ~310
  lines to under ~100 (one apply verb + one list verb). The corresponding
  client-side `routePublishCommand` choreography in `cmd/client/client.go`
  collapses to a single per-deploy call.
- `simple-vps init` scaffolds a default Dockerfile with proper layer
  ordering — `COPY package.json bun.lock ./` and `RUN bun install` before
  `COPY . .` — so that subsequent deploys hit the install-layer cache and
  rebuild only the code-copy step (typically 2-5 seconds). For static apps
  it scaffolds a `simple-vps.toml` pointing at the conventional output
  directory (`dist/` or `out/`).
- **Container supply-chain (base image trust).** Dockerfiles routinely
  reference mutable upstream tags (`FROM node:22`), which resolve to
  whatever the registry serves at build time. ADR-0003 and ADR-0004 are
  strict about host-side downloads; the equivalent strictness inside a
  build context is digest pinning (`FROM node:22@sha256:...`).
  simple-vps does not enforce digest pinning — the friction of manual
  SHA lookups on every base image bump outweighs the supply-chain win
  for the solo-dev VPS audience. `init` scaffolds with human-readable
  tags; users may pin to digests for apps where supply chain matters.
- Static apps share the `keep_releases` knob with container apps even
  though the retention mechanism differs (filesystem release dirs +
  symlink for static; tagged images in Podman storage for container).
  Same number, same meaning ("how many old releases stay rollbackable"),
  different storage. The user-facing model is uniform.
