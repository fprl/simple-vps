# ADR-0008: Manifest v2, env roots, and runtime identity

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-28
- **Supersedes/amends:** ADR-0005 manifest shape, service naming,
  `shared/` storage layout, and static shape; ADR-0006 label/identity
  assumptions and closed set; ADR-0007 backup payload path.

## Context

The container cutover made the implementation safer, but the public
manifest leaked too much runtime machinery:

- `[services.*]` did not match the mental model of "one image, multiple
  long-running processes."
- `[env.production.env]` was visually awkward and conceptually noisy.
- `tmpfs`, `net_bind_service`, and stock-image writable paths exposed
  Podman hardening details.
- `/var/apps/<app>/<env>/shared` mixed user data and generated runtime
  config.
- Nested env roots made `/var/apps/<app>` look like a lifecycle boundary
  even though every mutating operation is scoped to `(app, env)`.

There are no users yet, so v1 should remove these surfaces instead of
carrying compatibility aliases.

## Decision

### Manifest v2

The manifest remains `simple-vps.toml`.

Public config uses `processes`, not `services`. A process is one
long-running container process from the app image. Multiple processes
share one Dockerfile and one built image.

For container apps, non-secret env vars live in `[vars]`, with
env-specific overrides under `[env.<name>.vars]`. Static-only apps reject
`[vars]` because there is no runtime env to inject.

Route entries live in one `[routes.*]` namespace. A route has exactly
one target:

- `process = "web"` for Caddy reverse proxy to a process.
- `serve = "dist"` for Caddy `file_server` from a static directory.
- `redirect = "https://example.com"` for permanent redirects.

`path` is optional and means prefix routing. The omitted path owns the
whole host. Static `path = "/docs"` strips the `/docs` prefix before
file lookup.

Runtime limits are product-level resources:

```toml
[processes.web]
resources = { memory = "512m", cpus = 0.5 }
```

They are not raw Podman flags and they do not belong in the Dockerfile.

Deploy-time migrations use:

```toml
[deploy]
release = "bun run migrate"
```

The release command runs from the built image with resolved vars,
secrets, and `/data` mounted, before routed web processes move traffic.

### Removed public fields

These fields are not part of v1:

- route `type`
- public `tmpfs`
- `healthcheck_status`
- `net_bind_service`
- arbitrary Podman/Docker flags
- arbitrary host mounts
- multiple Dockerfiles/images per app
- first-class Litestream
- cron/scheduled jobs
- managed Postgres/Redis
- custom Caddy snippets

`healthcheck` is renamed to `health`.

### Host layout

Each `(app, env)` has a flat, human-readable env root:

```text
/var/apps/<app>.<env>/
  data/             # mounted into containers as /data; included in backup/restore
  runtime/.env      # generated runtime config; not user data
  static/           # static releases/assets when static routes are deployed
  simple-vps.toml   # applied manifest snapshot
  simple-vps.json   # env identity anchor
```

`/var/apps/<app>` is not a runtime identity primitive. The operational
unit is always `(app, env)`.

Containers mount only the data directory:

```text
/var/apps/<app>.<env>/data -> /data
```

The generated env file is passed through Podman's `--env-file`; it is
not mounted as user data.

### Derived infra ID

Human paths stay readable. Linux, Podman, DNS, and lock identifiers use
a bounded derived ID:

```text
infra_id = "svps-" + sha256(app + "\0" + env)[0:12]
```

Example:

```text
Host path:      /var/apps/api.production
Infra ID:       svps-a8f9b2c4d6e8
System user:    svps-a8f9b2c4d6e8
Network:        svps-a8f9b2c4d6e8
Container DNS:  svps-a8f9b2c4d6e8-web-f927362
Lock:           svps-a8f9b2c4d6e8.lock
```

The ID is deterministic and inspectable, but never reverse-parsed. The
identity anchor records and validates it:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "app": "api",
  "env": "production",
  "infra_id": "svps-a8f9b2c4d6e8"
}
```

Runtime discovery uses labels, not parsed names:

```text
simple-vps.app=api
simple-vps.env=production
simple-vps.process=web
simple-vps.infra_id=svps-a8f9b2c4d6e8
simple-vps.release=f927362
```

### Secrets

Secrets remain root-owned plaintext files under:

```text
/etc/simple-vps/secrets/<app>/<env>/<KEY>
```

The public command is `simple-vps secret set <env> <key>`. Values are
read from stdin only. Deploy resolves all `@secret:KEY` references
before any build or container mutation. Missing secrets fail fast.

### Handoff semantics

Routed web processes use versioned containers:

1. Build the image.
2. Run `[deploy].release`, if present.
3. Start the next versioned container.
4. Probe it from the Caddy/ingress network.
5. Render Caddy to the next container name.
6. Validate and reload Caddy.
7. Remove old containers for that process after reload succeeds.

Workers are stop-start by default. Overlapping workers are dangerous
without an explicit policy, so v1 does not try to make workers
zero-downtime.

### Static routes

Static-only apps are part of v1. Caddy serves uploaded static directories
directly; nginx is not involved. Static backups include the active static
release assets so restore can bring a static-only app back without
containers.

Mixed container plus static routes are useful, but may be deferred until
the static release metadata is clean. The public shape already reserves
`serve = "dist"` in the unified route namespace.

## Consequences

- The manifest is simpler and closer to the user intent.
- Runtime resources remain configurable without exposing raw Podman.
- SQLite and uploads have a clear default: write to `/data`.
- Backups snapshot `data/`, not generated runtime config.
- Static-only apps can exist without containers, so `simple-vps.json` is
  required for host-side env identity.
- App-wide operations scan metadata/labels instead of relying on a
  parent `/var/apps/<app>` directory.
- Old manifest names intentionally break before v1 users exist.
